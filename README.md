# Deep-Learning-Final
NKU 深度学习 2023春季大作业; NKU Deep-Learning Course Final Project

在本次作业中，我们尝试复现了8个模型，分别为：ResNet, VAN, RepLKNet, Coordinate Attention, GCNet, SKNet, Triplet Attention, Res2Net，并尝试对这些网络进行改进。实验结果在DPF报告中。

如果你想运行我们的代码，你可以进入另外的三个分支，并分别运行相应的原始网络和改进网络。main分支中仅代表分工。

In this assignment, we attempted to reproduce eight models: ResNet, VAN, RepLKNet, Coordinate Attention, GCNet, SKNet, Triplet Attention, and Res2Net. We also made efforts to enhance these networks. The experimental results can be found in the DPF report.

If you wish to run our code, you can navigate to three separate branches and execute the corresponding original networks and enhanced networks. The main branch is only meant to represent task division.
